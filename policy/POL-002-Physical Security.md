# 1. INTRODUCTION

## 1.1. PURPOSE

This policy provides information and guidance related to physical security practices at Mitoc Group Inc offices where management and/or support of customer’s cloud environments occurs. 

## 1.1. 1.2 DEFINITIONS, ACRONYMS, AND ABBREVIATION

**Amazon Web Services (AWS):** means a set of services that together form a reliable, scalable, and inexpensive computing platform “in the public cloud.”

**Mitoc Group Inc or Company:** means Mitoc Group, Inc. and it products and services including, but not limited to, software & cloud computing solutions to migrate its customers’ computing infrastructure away from expensive in-house servers and colocations facilities to professional public cloud based datacenters.

**Cardholder Data Environment (CDE):** means all processes and technology including individuals that store, process or transmit customer cardholder data or authentication data, connected system components, and any virtualization components (i.e., servers, applications, etc.)

**Electronic Personal Health Information (EPHI):** means individual personal health information (“PHI”) and electronic protected health information (“ePHI”) that is protected under applicable federal, state law, or regulations promulgated by HHS in accordance with HIPAA and HITECH, including applicable privacy and security standards, that a party uses, discloses, accesses, creates, maintains, transmits and/or receives for and on behalf of a customer.

**Tailgating:** This occurs when an unauthorized person slips in through a door before it closes.

**Piggybacking:** This occurs when an authorized person allows someone to follow them through a door to secure area. 

# 2. PHYSICAL SECURITY POLICY

## 2.1. RESTRICT PHYSICAL ACCESS TO CARDHOLDER DATA (PCI DSS 9.X):

The customer’s cloud infrastructure is hosted in the AWS cloud environment. There is no physical access allowed to any 2nd Watch employees or contractors, end-users, visitors, or third party users into any of the data centers that the managed environment runs on. AWS fully covers the physical security requirements for sensitive-data environments as long as entire the sensitive-data environments are hosted in AWS.

No sensitive data is copied or removed out of the AWS environment by either AWS or Mitoc Group. 

## 2.2. MITOC GROUP NOC LOCATION:

While no CDE, PHI or ePHI records are stored within the Mitoc Group owned facilities, Mitoc Group may manage customer’s ePHI or CDE infrastructure on behalf of the customer for monitoring, alerting, and troubleshooting various components. Mitoc Grouop has no physical device access into the customer’s AWS infrastructure. Additionally, only logical access to the customer’s components are permitted through pre-approved and authorized access based on established access control methods.

Mitoc Group operates primarily from its 404Moldova location, which maintains physical security via privileged key access to authorized Mitoc Group employees and/or contractors. 

## 2.3. VISITORS TO MITOC GROUP LOCATIONS:

Records for approved personnel access and sign-in sheets for visitors are maintained at the Mitoc Grouo facilities. Logs are periodically reviewed for violations or suspicious activities, which are further investigated and action is taken to address areas of concern.

All Mitoc Group visitors must sign into the main lobby or entrance location when entering any of the Mitoc Grouo operated premises. Sign-in information should include at a minimum:

        * Visitor’s name/phone
        * date/time-in/time-out
        * Mitoc Group Host-person they are visiting or the main contact at Mitoc Group
        * Purpose or reason for the visit

All visitors must wear a visible “visitor” badge to identify themselves as visitors.

MItoc Group Inc employees should be aware of visitors and/or new faces in the Mitoc Group facilities and encourage visitors to sign in and wear a badge if they haven’t already done so.

Every employee should take appropriate actions to mitigate tailgating or piggybacking behavior whenever witnessed. For example, ask appropriate questions to find out who the subject is, what is the purpose of their visit, who they are going to see, then escort them to the host. The host is responsible for ensuring that visitors are signed in. If you find a door that is propped open, please close it. If you find a door that does not automatically close or has a broken lock, contact Vladimir Ursu at vlad@mitocgrouo.com. Below are the specific building manager contacts for the specific facility:
