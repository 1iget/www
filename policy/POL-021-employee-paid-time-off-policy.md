# 1. OVERVIEW

See Purpose.

# 2. PURPOSE

Our Employee PTO policy or paid time off policy refers to the amount of time off that may be granted to employees per calendar year or month. Paid time off is a benefit that may determine the Mitoc Group’s (the "Company") retention of talent and employee productivity. Paid time off can be considered equivalent to vacation time and sick time, or can designate between each. 

If it is aligned with the company’s capabilities it would be advantageous for any company to offer a specified amount of vacation and paid time off, whether it is mandated by law or not. 

This policy outlines the accrual process for paid time off, and how employees can manage this benefit.

# 3. SCOPE

This policy applies to all employees of the company that have a permanent or long term contract with the company.

# 4. POLICY 

The company may adjust its time off policy according to business needs and corporate objectives. At any case however, the company will not grant less paid leave than is dictated by law.

Paid time off refers to the amount of days off that an employee can take throughout a month or year and for which they will be compensated. Those include:

 - Vacation Leave

 - Personal Leave

This leave is separate from parental leave or sick leave as these may be subjected to different legal or company guidelines (e.g. sick leave may require a doctor’s note). Other kinds of leave such as bereavement leave, jury duty leave etc. will be considered if the need arises. It falls under the company’s judgement to incorporate the different options of leave under a uniform amount of time off that can be used for different reasons.

Reasons for requesting personal leave need not be specified. Personal leave may also need less time prior notice whereas vacation time may need to be scheduled well in advance. Both PTO leaves must be approved by the appropriate manager.

It is best for employees to distribute the use of their PTO equally throughout the year and not accumulate their entire leave and use it all at the same time. Unused PTO may or may not be passed on to the next calendar year. Vacation accrual is subject to the company’s judgement.

Employees may earn some additional PTO every year or per another specified amount of time. Once the total time off reaches a specified limit, it cannot surpass it.

The company encourages employees to use their PTO so as to avoid incidents of low productivity and burnout. Personal Leave may also contribute positively to employee engagement, satisfaction and efficiency.

### Unpaid Leave

In some cases an employee may reach the PTO limit that they are entitled to and still need to be absent from work. In such cases, the company may consider giving the opportunity of unpaid time off. This time off must be specified in advance and can be up to a certain limit. The company will follow all legal requirements that may exist on the subject.
