# 4. POLICY 

## 4.1. General Information

Discrimination in the workplace is any kind of direct or indirect negative action or attitude towards an employee that is founded in one or more characteristics of said employee which are subject to protection by law and that might create an intimidating, threatening or uncomfortable environment of employment.

Discrimination can refer to different forms of diversity including but not limiting to:

- gender
- sexual orientation
- ethnicity or nationality
- religion or beliefs
- age
- disability
- medical history
- marital status

## 4.2. What is an EEO policy?

Areas where the company will engage in preventive as well as affirmative action to ensure equal opportunity include hiring, training, performance evaluation, promotions, compensation, benefits and termination. The list is by no means exhaustive and any other process or function will also be subject to dictations by law and company policy.

The company will strictly refrain from demonstrating bias or prejudice towards individual differences which will be valued and protected. People will be given the chance to work in a discrimination-free environment which will help everyone feel that their worth and rights are respected.
Actions

Actions aiming towards equal opportunity include the following:

- use of inclusive, diversity-sensitive language in all official documents, signs etc.
- modification of structures and facilities to accommodate people with disabilities
- leave and flexible work arrangement policies to provide for parental, medical or other needs

- inclusion of religious or national holidays of all people that are part of the workforce in the companyâ€™s official schedule and arrange their leaves upon request

- open door practices to make the reporting of unlawful discriminatory conduct easier
- active encouragement of employees to propose improvements
- explicit prohibition of discrimination and clearly defined consequences

## 4.3. Grievance Procedure

All supervisors and managers are responsible to ensure that policies of equal opportunity are applied at all times and that all procedures and practices are free of discrimination. All staff are obliged to follow legal guidelines and equal opportunity employer principles.

In cases when these rules are violated, employees can address the offender directly. If the issue is not resolved they can report to Human Resources department or their immediate supervisor. The report will be investigated as soon as possible and all parties will be listened to. The employee that suffered the offence will be protected against harassment and victimization.
