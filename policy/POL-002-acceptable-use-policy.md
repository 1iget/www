# 1. OVERVIEW

Mitoc Group Inc (the "Company") intentions for publishing an Acceptable Use
Policy are not to impose restrictions that are contrary to the Company's
established culture of openness, trust and integrity. The Company is committed
to protecting its employees, partners and customers from illegal or damaging
actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

Internet/Intranet/Extranet-related systems, including but not limited to
computer equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network
accounts providing electronic mail, WWW browsing, and FTP, are the property
of the Company. These systems are to be used for business purposes in serving
the interests of the company, and of our clients and customers in the course
of normal operations.

Effective security is a team effort involving the participation and support of
every Company's employee and affiliate who deals with information and/or
information systems. It is the responsibility of every computer user to know
these guidelines, and to conduct their activities accordingly.


# 2. PURPOSE 

The purpose of this policy is to outline the acceptable use of computer
equipment at the Company. These rules are in place to protect the employee and
the Company. Inappropriate use exposes the Company to risks including virus
attacks, compromise of network systems and services, and legal issues.


# 3. SCOPE

This policy applies to the use of information, electronic and computing
devices, and network resources to conduct Company's business or interact with
internal networks and business systems, whether owned or leased by the Company,
the employee, or a third party. All employees, contractors, consultants,
temporary, and other workers at the Company and its subsidiaries are
responsible for exercising good judgment regarding appropriate use of
information, electronic devices, and network resources in accordance with
Company's policies and standards, and local laws and regulation. Exceptions to
this policy are documented in section 5.2

This policy applies to employees, contractors, consultants, temporaries, and
other workers at the Company, including all personnel affiliated with third
parties. This policy applies to all equipment that is owned or leased by the
Company.

## 4.1 General Use and Ownership

4.1.1   Company's proprietary information stored on electronic and computing

the extent it is authorized and necessary to fulfill your assigned job duties.

4.1.4	Employees are responsible for exercising good judgment regarding the

systems. In the absence of such policies, employees should be guided by
departmental policies on personal use, and if there is any uncertainty,
employees should consult their supervisor or manager.

screensaver with the automatic activation feature set to 10 minutes or less.
You must lock the screen or log off when the device is unattended.

should contain a disclaimer stating that the opinions expressed are strictly

course of business duties.

received from unknown senders, which may contain malware.


## 4.3	Unacceptable Use

The following activities are, in general, prohibited. Employees may be
exempted from these restrictions during the course of their legitimate job
responsibilities (e.g., systems administration staff may have a need to

services).

**Honey pot** - Programs that simulate one or more network services that you
designate on your computer's ports. An attacker assumes you're running
vulnerable services that can be used to break into the machine. A honey pot
can be used to log access attempts to those ports including the attacker's
keystrokes. This could give you advanced warning of a more concerted attack.

**Honey net** - A honeynet is a vulnerable and simulated computer network using
a decoy server designed to test network security. Honeynets are developed in
order to help computer security experts to improve security for networks and
systems.

**Proprietary Information** - Proprietary information is that information
unique to a company and its ability to compete, such as customer lists,
technical data, product costs, and trade secrets.

**Spam** - Electronic junk mail or junk newsgroup postings.
