# 1. POLICY STATEMENT

Mitoc Group Inc (the "Company") is committed to recruiting and
retaining qualified employees and to protect the company's
assets and property as well as that of the customers of the
Company. Due to this commitment, Mitoc Group has established
an employment background investigation policy.

This policy applies to all full- and part-time employees of the
Company and extends to any contract personnel that may provide
services for the Company or its customers.

As a condition of employment or continued employment (as deemed
necessary), the Company shall conduct such background investigations
or hire the services of a third party vendor to conduct the
investigations. The Company performs a series of screens (i.e.,
criminal screen, felony and misdemeanor) on new job applicants,
as well as current employees being considered (and eligible)
for transfer or promotion into another position. As used in this policy,
the term "candidate" can mean either a new job applicant or current
employee being considered for transfer or promotion, as applicable.

The purpose of the policy is to determine or confirm, within
appropriate legal limits, certain qualifications and the suitability
of a candidate for the particular position for which the applicant
or employee is being considered.

Additionally, the Company shall require, in its contracts, any
subcontractor or agent, who refers candidates for employment or as
contract employees to perform work at the Company or its customers,
to adhere to the requirements set forth in this policy.


# 2. POLICY

## 2.1. INTRODUCTION:

The Company will perform background checks on all candidates, and shall
determine, in its sole discretion, the type and number of background
checks to be performed. The Company will treat all candidates fairly and
consistently, and will review each candidate on his or her own merits,
and make employment decisions based upon the totality of each candidate's
qualifications and the results of background checks. In general, the
relevance of background check results to a candidate's eligibility for
employment is based upon the following factors:

- the nature of the job for which the candidate is being considered;
- the nature of any adverse or negative information; and
- in the case of adverse or negative information, how recently
  the adverse or negative incident occurred and the age of the
  candidate at the time of the incident.

No offer of employment or promotion is final or binding until all necessary
screenings are complete and Human Resources (HR) notifies recruiting or
the hiring manager that a final offer can be made.

## 2.2. ELIGIBLE CHECKS:

The components of each candidate's background check will depend on the
position the candidate is seeking. The Company has contracted with a
third-party vendor and, upon request, can perform any of the following
checks:

- Widescreen Plus National Criminal Search
- Social Security Validation
- Social Security Trace
- Criminal Felony and Misdemeanor
- Statewide Criminal
- Felony Criminal
- National Sex Offender Registry Search
- Terrorist Watch List (Prohibited Parties)
- Drug test (as applicable)
- International Investigation

In the event the candidate is a rehire who has not been employed by
the Company for more than six (6) months, he or she will be subject
to screening upon return, based on the requirements of the new position.

## 2.3. CRIMINAL BACKGROUND SEARCH:

The Company reserves the right to perform criminal background checks
for all positions of the company.

All new hires (including contractors) are subject to a criminal background
check. If rehired prior to six (6) months, it is at the sole discretion of
the Company to perform a criminal background check on the rehire.

Criminal background checks may be conducted annually or anytime at the
request of Company's new client. All criminal checks will be at the sole
discretion of the Company and will follow the background check procedures
and responsibilities.  Client facing employees (i.e., PS and MS) will be
subject to a re-run of the background check every 5 years of continuous
employment.

A criminal background check which shall consist, at minimum, of a federal
and state check for felony and misdemeanor criminal convictions (or the
equivalent thereof under relevant non-US law) in all locations where the
assigned employee has resided, has been employed, or has attended school
in the immediately preceding seven (7) years and a check of U.S.
Government Specially Designated National and export denial lists. The
criminal history check will also include, to the extent available,
a check for outstanding warrants or pending felony charges in all such
locations. Statewide county searches shall be performed in all states
where such search mechanism is available without requiring specialized
data (such as fingerprints or DNA), and the National Criminal File
database shall also be searched.

## 2.4. DRUG TESTING:

The Company reserves the right to perform drug screening on current
employees and candidates for the following positions:

- All positions where work may be performed on a client site and
  is required by the respective client as a condition of their
  employment practices.

Current employees are also subject to drug screens when:

- Involved with work related injuries or accidents totaling more
  than $500 in damages;
- As part of a "fit-for-duty" examination, or when the contracted
  Client otherwise requires a drug screen
- The Company has reasonable cause or suspicion to believe that
  an employee is either under the influence of, or is suspected
  of using, alcohol or drugs on the job, or in a manner affecting
  his or her job performance

Refer to the Substance Abuse Policy for additional policy and procedural
guidelines for drug testing at the Company.

## 2.5. INTERNATIONAL INVESTIVATION:

An international investigation shall be conducted when an applicant is
coming directly from another country or when the applicant was a resident
outside the US during the last seven (7) years. This investigation shall
be conducted by an accredited international agency in the appropriate
country.

Other investigations as deemed necessary by the Company or a customer
of the Company.


# 3. ADDITONAL INFORMATION:

The Company shall abide by the contract terms and requirements of specific
customers; however, in no circumstance will the Company assign employees
to provide services to customers who:

- have been convicted of a felony or misdemeanor (or the equivalent
  thereof under relevant non-US law), or for whom a warrant is
  outstanding, or for whom a felony or misdemeanor charge is currently
  pending, or is on a U.S. Government Specially Designated National or
  export denial list.  The foregoing shall not apply to a minor traffic
  violation (a moving traffic violation other than reckless driving,
  hit and run, driving to endanger, vehicular homicide, driving while
  intoxicated or other criminal offense involving gross negligence,
  recklessness, intentional or willful misconduct while operating
  a motor vehicle), to a conviction that has been legally expunged,
  or to a conviction for a misdemeanor that occurred while the employee
  was under the age of twenty-one years; or
- have a confirmed positive test result from the drug testing, or
- does not have the legal right to work in the jurisdiction in which
  the employee will be performing services.


# 4. BACKGROUND CHECK RESPONSIBILITIES:

## 4.1. CANDIDATE  RESPONSIBILITY:

- All candidates are required to sign appropriate releases and
  authorizations before the Company performs background checks.
- Candidates shall not provide false or misleading information
  in an application, release or authorization. Any candidate
  providing such information may be eliminated from any further
  consideration. Candidates shall provide accurate and complete
  information and must not omit material information needed for
  the Company to make a decision.
- Candidates who refuse to sign the release or participate in
  screening will be terminated if a current employee, or will
  no longer be considered for employment with the Company if
  a candidate for new hire.

## 4.2. COMPANY RESPONSIBILITY:

- Human Resources will initiate background searches at the time
  of an employment offer or offer of promotion is made (offer
  contingent upon successful completion).
- A criminal record does not automatically disqualify a candidate
  from consideration for employment or promotion. However,
  a criminal record may be a relevant consideration depending on
  the nature of the conviction and the specific position for which
  the candidate is being considered. Human Resources will utilize
  a criminal conviction disqualification matrix for hiring or
  promotion guidance to screen for relevant criminal background
  information.
- When necessary and prior to making employment or promotion
  decisions, Human Resources will review preliminary screening
  results and consult with Legal Counsel if necessary.
- The Company will not reject a candidate based on criminal check
  results until the Company (or its third-party vendor) sends the
  candidate any pre-adverse and adverse action notices required under
  federal or state laws.
- The Company may consider extenuating circumstances, such as illness,
  divorce or other family problems, in analyzing background check results.


# 5. LEGAL DISCLAIMER

The Company's policy is to comply with all applicable federal, state and local
laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company does business.

The Company will keep the results of all background checks confidential,
disclosing the results only to Company employees and consultants on a strict
"need to know" basis.

All investigations will be conducted in compliance with the federal Fair Credit
Reporting Act (FRCA), the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), and any other
applicable local, state or federal laws and regulations.

This Policy is not intended to limit the types of background checks that the
Company may decide to perform, or to provide a detailed decision-making process
after receiving the results of a background check. This Policy does not limit
the Company's right to hire, discipline or terminate any employee. This Policy
does not create a contract of employment with any employee, and the
relationship between the Company and any employee is "at-will." If you have
questions about these subjects, please contact Human Resources.
