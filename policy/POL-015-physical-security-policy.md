# 3. SCOPE


# 4. POLICY

## 4.1. Secure Areas:

4.1.1 Entry Controls

Information Security Team must establish the appropriate type and number of restricted zones to achieve the necessary conditions for employee safety, and for the protection of sensitive or valuable information and assets. Establishment of restricted zones must be supported by a Security Threat and Risk Assessment.

Access to any information processing facility or areas where sensitive information is kept must be restricted. Access to restricted zones must be controlled, authorized and monitored as required by the applicable zone. Entry controls must identify, authenticate and log all access attempts to a Restricted Access Operations Zone or a Restricted Access Security Zone as follows:
* Restricted Access Operation Zone access is limited to company employees and their escorted visitors (i.e., standard working areas, conference rooms, offices); 

* Restricted Access Security Zone access is limited to authorized employees and their escorted visitors (i.e., communication closets, server rooms).

Every person authorized to enter a facility, including visitors, must be issued an identification badge that
contains identifying information (such as name and photograph) and their level of building access. Badge colour or some other bold identifier may be used to represent the level of access.
* All badges must be checked prior to entry. A receptionist, security guard or electronic reader that logs the identity, time, date, and access privileges of each entry attempt must do such checking. Entry control may be achieved using keys, proximity card readers or other technologies;

* Employees must challenge anyone in a secure area who is not displaying an identification badge;

* Visitor or temporary access badges must be returned and accounted for at the end of each day;

* Entry logs must be reviewed on a quarterly basis;

* All entry logs must be secured and maintained according to the approved records retention schedule for the system or information asset; and,
* Access rights to secure areas must be reviewed and updated regularly.

When physical security is outsourced (i.e., the use of security guards) the contract must require that contracted employees are security screened and bonded.

4.1.2  Physical security requirements

Information Security Team must design, document and approve security controls for information processing facilities based on a Security Threat and Risk Assessment. Considerations must include:

* Determining security perimeter and maintenance factors;

* Considering the operational use and information processing requirements of the facility;

* Establishing appropriate security zones;

* Design and construction complying with health and safety regulations and standards;

* Designed with environmental controls for the protection of information assets (e.g., fire suppression, HVAC, generators, alarms);

* Selecting unobtrusive sites and keep signage to the minimum required for meeting fire and other safety requirements;

* Limiting the identification of critical information processing facility locations, in publicly and
internally available directories, to the minimum required;

* Selecting sites so that public access to highly sensitive or critical locations can be strictly
controlled or avoided.

4.1.3 Physical protection against natural disasters, malicious attacks or accidents

Information Security Team, site planners and architects must incorporate physical security controls that protect against damage from fire, flood, earthquake, explosion, civil unrest and other forms of natural disasters, malicious attacks and accidents. Consideration must be given to any security threats presented by neighbouring premises or streets. In addition to meeting building code specifications and fire regulations, the following must be considered:

* Combustible or hazardous materials must be stored in purposely designed rooms and in
appropriate containers;

* Installing intrusion detection and environmental alarm systems, fire suppression and firefighting systems must be included in the design phase;

* Fallback equipment (e.g., for Disaster Recovery Plan) and backup media must be sited at a safe distance to avoid damage from a disaster affecting the main site.

4.1.4 Secure area requirements for employees

Information Security Team must identify and document requirements that apply to employees authorized to work in secure areas. Information Owners must ensure that background checks including criminal records reviews are conducted for employees working in secure areas.

Information Security Team are responsible for informing employees working within a secure area that:

* Activities within a secure area are confidential and must not be discussed in a non-secure area - sensitive information must not be discussed with persons without a need-to-know;

* No type of photographic (including cameras in mobile devices), video, audio or other recording equipment is to be operated in a Restricted Access Security Zone unless authorized;

* Information security incidents must be reported immediately.

4.1.5 Other secure area requirements

Information Security Team must identify and document requirements for other individuals who may need access to a secure area. Information Security Team are responsible for ensuring that:

* Maintenance employees, cleaners and others who may require access on an ongoing basis to the secure area must be screened and their names placed on access lists;

* Visitors must obtain approval for visits, be screened, and their entry and departure times logged;

* Employees must escort visitors when they are within secure areas;

* Unoccupied secure areas must be physically locked and periodically checked;

* Physical intrusion alarms and detection devices must be installed to automatically alert monitoring employees of a breach.

## 4.2 Equipment Security

4.2.1 Security controls

The Information Security Team must ensure that equipment being used off-site to access confidential information is protected commensurate with the sensitivity and the value of the information it contains. The Information Security Team must ensure that:

* Sensitive data is encrypted;

* Equipment is protected from unauthorized access by the use of a logical or physical access control mechanism (e.g., password, USB key or smart card);

* Equipment is protected from loss with a physical locking, restraint or security mechanism when appropriate;

* Employees are familiar with operation of the protection technologies in use.

To provide further protection employees must:

* Not leave equipment unattended in a public place;

* Ensure that equipment is under their direct control at all times when travelling;

* Take measures to prevent viewing of sensitive information other than by authorized persons;

* Not permit other persons to use the equipment;

* Report loss of equipment immediately to the Information Security Team (security@mitocgroup.com) 

4.2.2  Reassignment of hardware and media

Information Security Team must consider the value and sensitivity of the information stored on hardware or media when determining whether it will be reassigned within Company or destroyed. Reassignment must only occur within or between Company. Prior to reassignment of hardware or media, Information Security Team must ensure:

* Information and software are erased using methods and standards approved by the Information Security Team;

* Roles and responsibilities are documented;

* Asset inventories are updated to record details of the erasure and reassignment including:

    * Asset identifier,

    * Date of erasure,

    * Names of employees conducting the erasure,

    * Date of transfer,
    
Where information is erased by third parties there must be contractual and audit procedures to ensure complete destruction of the media. Third parties must certify that destruction has occurred.

4.2.3 Protection of unattended equipment

Information Security Team must ensure that employees are aware of their responsibilities to secure unattended equipment to prevent unauthorized access to information systems by:

* Locking or terminating information system sessions before leaving the equipment unattended;

* Enabling password protection features on the equipment (e.g., screen savers on workstations);

* Shutting down and restarting unattended workstations at the end of each workday;

* Enabling password protection on mobile devices including portable storage devices; and,

* Being aware of their responsibility to report security weaknesses where the above controls have not been applied.

Company's workstations and other devices used for information system access must automatically activate screen savers or equivalent locking systems after 15 or less minutes of inactivity.

4.2.4 Securing the work space

Employees must secure their work space whenever it is not supervised by an authorized person, including during short breaks, attendance at meetings, and at the end of the work day.

Securing the work space includes:

* Clearing desk tops and work areas;

* Securing documents and mobile or portable storage devices in a locked desk or file cabinet;

* Ensuring outgoing and incoming mail is appropriately secured;

* Enabling a password protected screen saver;

* Shutting down and restarting workstations at the end of each work day;

* Locking doors and windows;

* Checking fax machines and printers to ensure that no sensitive information is waiting to be picked up.

4.2.5 Secure work habits

Employees must develop and implement security conscious work habits to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized viewing, access or disclosure of sensitive information.

Security conscious work habits include:

* Ensuring sensitive information is protected from accidental viewing by persons passing through the work space;

* Ensuring that only the documents required for current work are out of their normal file cabinet;

* Ensuring white boards, bulletin boards, flip charts do not contain sensitive information when the
viewing audience cannot be defined;

* Covering up, filing or storing paper documents when visitors are present in the work area;

* Clearing, changing or turning off the computer screen (e.g., minimize open Windows) so that sensitive information is not displayed when visitors are present in the work area;

* Not discussing sensitive information in open work spaces or public areas.
