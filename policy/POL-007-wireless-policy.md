The purpose of this policy is to secure and protect the information assets owned by Mitoc Group (the "Company"). The Company provides computer devices, networks, and other electronic information systems to meet missions, goals, and initiatives.

Only those wireless infrastructure devices that meet the standards specified in this policy or are granted an exception by the Information Security Department are approved for connectivity to a Company's network.
