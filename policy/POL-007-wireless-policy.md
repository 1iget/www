# 1. OVERVIEW

With the mass explosion of Smart Phones and Tablets, pervasive wireless connectivity is almost
a given at any organization. Insecure wireless configuration can provide an easy open door for
malicious threat actors. 


# 2. PURPOSE

The purpose of this policy is to secure and protect the information assets owned by Mitoc Group. Mitoc Group provides computer devices, networks, and other electronic
information systems to meet missions, goals, and initiatives. Mitoc Group grants access to
these resources as a privilege and must manage them responsibly to maintain the confidentiality,
integrity, and availability of all information assets.
This policy specifies the conditions that wireless infrastructure devices must satisfy to connect to
Mitoc Group network. Only those wireless infrastructure devices that meet the standards
specified in this policy or are granted an exception by the Information Security Department are
approved for connectivity to a Mitoc Group network.


# 3. SCOPE

All employees, contractors, consultants, temporary and other workers at Mitoc Group,
including all personnel affiliated with third parties that maintain a wireless infrastructure device
on behalf of Mitoc Group must adhere to this policy. This policy applies to all wireless
infrastructure devices that connect to a Mitoc Group network or reside on a Mitoc Group site that provide wireless connectivity to endpoint devices including, but not limited to,
laptops, desktops, cellular phones, and tablets. This includes any form of wireless
communication device capable of transmitting packet data
