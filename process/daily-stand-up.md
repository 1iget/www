**Daily Scrum / Stand-up**
---------------------------

### **What is a Daily Scrum/Stand-up?**

The Daily Scrum is a 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize
activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours. This is done by inspecting the work since the
last Daily Scrum and forecasting the work that could be done before the next one. The Daily
Scrum is held at the same time and place each day to reduce complexity. During the meeting,
the Development Team members explain:
- What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the
Sprint Goal?

### **How we do it?**

In order to reduce complexity and physical presence on the meeting the Daily Scrum was replaced with Daily Stand-up Emails.

1. **When to Send the email?.** 

The email should be sent on daily basis as working day starts.

2. **Whom should I sent the email?.** 

The email is sent to Devs Deep <devs-deep@mitocgroup.com>

3. **What should be included in the email?**
- What did I do yesterday that helped the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- What will I do today to help the Development Team meet the Sprint Goal?
- Do I see any impediment that prevents me or the Development Team from meeting the
Sprint Goal?

4. **Why do we need this stand-up mails, they are time consuming?**

The Team uses the Daily Scrum to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and to inspect how progress is trending toward completing the work. The Daily Scrum optimizes the probability that the Team will meet the Sprint Goal. Every day, the Team should understand how it intends to work together as a selforganizing team to accomplish the Sprint Goal and create the anticipated Increment by the end of the Sprint.

5. **What are the benefits?**
- The Team is in sync on how things are going
- Task correction
- Building trust between team members
- Encouraging personal planning
- High visibility of progress
- Self-organization in Team
