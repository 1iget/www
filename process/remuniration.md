**Remunerations v.1.0.**
---------------------------

### **TEAM & PERSONAL GOALS ACHIEVEMENT BONUS**

At the end of the Development Cycle (every 2 months) upon goals
achievement - a remuneration is offered on team and personal level.

Below is the formula that’s used to calculate your end of cycle bonus:

1.  Your hourly rate is multiplied with 2,088 hours to calculate your
    annual theoretical revenue

2.  Bonus rate is defined as 20% of your annual theoretical revenue

3.  The result is divided by 6 to establish the bonus for the period
    (e.g. Nov-Dec 2016, Jan-Feb 2017)

4.  If personal goals are achieved, you get 50% of the bonus

5.  If team goals are achieved, you get the other 50% of the bonus

6.  The calculation is binary, meaning that if you didn’t achieve all
    goals, you get 0% of the bonus

Note: If your rate increased, the bonus is calculated based on the new
rate vs the old one.

We want to incentivize good behavior and positive results, but if we see
negative change in behavior or results, we’ll have to revisit this
approach and the bonus formula.
